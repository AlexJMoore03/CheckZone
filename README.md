# CheckZone
# The code checks if a given point is in a cone-shaped zone, such as from casted by a spotlight.
# The code asks you to define a ray with an origin point (the tip of the cone) and a direction vector (pointing perpindicular towards the base of the cone).
# It then asks for the point you are trying to check.
# It then asks for the angle of the zone. This refers to the entire angle of the top of the cone (i.e. this angle could be spun 360 degrees to define the entire cone)
# It then asks for the distance from the origin point of the ray. This could be thought of as the height of the cone.
