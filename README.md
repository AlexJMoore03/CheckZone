This was written for a puzzle game I worked on in Roblox. The code is for a wall-mounted turret that fires a laser at the player if they are within a certain distance and angle of the turret. I enjoyed applying my knowledge of trigonometry and linear algebra, and it was a satisfying challenge. Mnths later, I converted it to a .py file where you can input the position and direction of the turret, and check if a point is within a specified distance and angle. View the demonstration image to see how it works.
